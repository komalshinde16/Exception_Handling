Exception handling in Java is used to handle runtime errors and prevent program crashes.
It maintains the normal flow of the program even if an error occurs.
Java uses keywords like `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, and `throws` for handling exceptions.
Exceptions are mainly of two types: checked (compile-time) and unchecked (runtime).
